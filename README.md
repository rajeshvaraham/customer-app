The Customer Application is designed to capture and store basic customer details in a MySQL database. It is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, with a focus on scalability, security, and simplicity. The application allows users to perform operations such as adding new customers, viewing customer details, and managing the data via a REST API.

Key Features:

API Endpoints: Expose a set of RESTful APIs to handle customer data (e.g., create, retrieve, update, delete customer records).
Database Integration: MySQL is used as the database to store customer information, including name, email, phone number, etc.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js is used to handle requests and responses, as well as interact with the MySQL database.
Frontend: The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.
GitHub Integration: The project is managed using Git for version control and hosted on GitHub for collaboration and version tracking.
